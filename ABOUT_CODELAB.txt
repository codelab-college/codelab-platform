# What is CodeLab?

CodeLab is a comprehensive academic coding platform designed specifically for educational institutions to manage programming assignments, practice problems, contests, and student assessments.

## Overview

CodeLab is a web-based platform that bridges the gap between teachers and students in computer science education. It provides a centralized system for assignment management, code submission, automated testing, and performance tracking.

## Key Features

### For Students
- **Dashboard**: Personalized view of assignments, deadlines, and progress
- **Assignments**: Access and submit programming assignments with deadlines
- **Practice Problems**: Solve coding problems at your own pace to improve skills
- **Code Editor**: Built-in Monaco editor with syntax highlighting for multiple languages
- **Real-time Testing**: Run code against sample test cases before submission
- **Submissions History**: Track all your submissions and review past attempts
- **Contests**: Participate in coding competitions with time-based challenges
- **Leaderboard**: See rankings and compare performance with peers
- **Badges System**: Earn achievements for solving problems and milestones
- **Dark/Light Theme**: Toggle between themes for comfortable coding

### For Teachers
- **Assignment Creation**: Create timed or untimed programming assignments
- **Problem Management**: Add problems with custom test cases and constraints
- **Student Access Control**: Assign to all students or select specific ones
- **Automated Grading**: Test cases automatically evaluate student submissions
- **Performance Analytics**: Track student progress and submission statistics
- **Contest Organization**: Create and manage coding contests
- **Notifications**: Send announcements and updates to students

### For Administrators
- **User Management**: Create and manage student, teacher, and admin accounts
- **System Monitoring**: Overview of platform usage and statistics
- **Bulk Operations**: Import/export users, reset passwords, manage access
- **Database Management**: Initialize and seed database with sample data

## Technical Specifications

### Supported Programming Languages
- JavaScript (Node.js)
- Python
- C++
- More languages can be easily added

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Monaco Editor
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: SQLite (can be upgraded to PostgreSQL)
- **Authentication**: JWT-based secure authentication
- **Code Execution**: Sandboxed environment for safe code execution

## How It Works

1. **Teacher Creates Assignment**
   - Sets title, description, deadline, and duration
   - Adds problems with input/output specifications
   - Defines test cases (sample and hidden)
   - Assigns to students or specific groups

2. **Student Receives Assignment**
   - Views assignment on dashboard with deadline
   - Reads problem statement and constraints
   - Writes code in the built-in editor
   - Tests code against sample test cases

3. **Code Submission**
   - Student submits final solution
   - Backend executes code against all test cases
   - System calculates score based on passed tests
   - Instant feedback with verdict (AC/WA/TLE/RTE)

4. **Automated Evaluation**
   - Code runs in isolated sandbox environment
   - Compares output with expected results
   - Tracks execution time and memory usage
   - Awards marks based on test case pass rate

5. **Results & Analytics**
   - Students see detailed results and execution time
   - Teachers view submission statistics
   - Leaderboard updates for contests
   - Progress tracking over time

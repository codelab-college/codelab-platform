# Render Deployment Checklist

## ✅ Pre-Deployment (Completed)

- [x] Created `render.yaml` for Blueprint deployment
- [x] Added environment variable examples (`.env.example`)
- [x] Updated API service to use environment variables
- [x] Configured CORS for production
- [x] Added build scripts for both services
- [x] Optimized Vite production build
- [x] Created deployment documentation
- [x] Pushed code to GitHub

## 📋 Deployment Steps

### Option A: Blueprint (Easiest - Use This!)

1. [ ] Go to https://dashboard.render.com/
2. [ ] Click "New +" → "Blueprint"
3. [ ] Connect your GitHub repo: `codelab-college/codelab-platform`
4. [ ] Render detects `render.yaml` automatically
5. [ ] Click "Apply"
6. [ ] Wait for both services to deploy (~10 minutes)
7. [ ] Copy backend URL from dashboard
8. [ ] Go to frontend environment variables
9. [ ] Set `VITE_API_URL` to `https://YOUR-BACKEND-URL.onrender.com/api`
10. [ ] Go to backend environment variables
11. [ ] Set `FRONTEND_URL` to `https://YOUR-FRONTEND-URL.onrender.com`
12. [ ] Both services will auto-redeploy
13. [ ] Done! 🎉

### Option B: Manual (If Blueprint doesn't work)

Follow instructions in [RENDER_QUICKSTART.md](RENDER_QUICKSTART.md)

## 🔑 Default Login Credentials

After deployment, test with:
- **Student**: USN `1MS21CS001`, Password `password123`
- **Teacher**: USN `TCSE001`, Password `password123`  
- **Admin**: USN `ADMIN001`, Password `password123`

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Change these passwords immediately in production!**

## 🔍 Post-Deployment Verification

1. [ ] Backend health check works: `https://YOUR-BACKEND/health`
2. [ ] Frontend loads without errors
3. [ ] Can login as student
4. [ ] Can view assignments
5. [ ] Can submit code to practice problems
6. [ ] No CORS errors in browser console

## 🐛 Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Frontend can't connect | Check `VITE_API_URL` includes `/api` |
| CORS errors | Update `FRONTEND_URL` in backend |
| 500 errors on backend | Check logs for database issues |
| Slow first load | Normal - free tier sleeps after 15min |
| Build fails | Check node version (should use latest) |

## 📝 Environment Variables Reference

### Backend
```
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=10000
JWT_SECRET=<auto-generated>
FRONTEND_URL=https://your-frontend.onrender.com
```

### Frontend
```
VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend.onrender.com/api
```

## 🚀 After Successful Deployment

1. **Update README** with your live URLs
2. **Change default passwords**
3. **Test all features**:
   - [ ] Login/Logout
   - [ ] View Assignments
   - [ ] Submit Solutions
   - [ ] Practice Problems
   - [ ] Dark Mode Toggle
4. **Monitor logs** for any errors
5. **Share with users!** 🎊

## 💡 Tips

- Services on free tier sleep after 15 minutes of inactivity
- First request may take 30-50 seconds to wake up
- Database persists across deploys (using SQLite on disk)
- Auto-deploys enabled when you push to GitHub
- Logs available in Render dashboard
